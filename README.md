# Project-Profile-Generator

## Description

In this challenge, I want to create a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

- My motivation for this project was to test my knowledge on being a back-end developer by implementing constructors, having a functioning terminal, and a script-generated HTML file.
